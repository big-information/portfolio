                 <p class="lead border-bottom mt-2 mb-3 pb-3">Serving as Design Lead throughout a partnership between RedMane and Alaska's Department of Health and Human Services (DHSS) to support the State's Medicaid eligibility system.</p>
                <p>In 2021 Redmane engaged the State of Alaska Department of Health and Human services to provide systems support to the state's Medicaid Eligibility System, ARIES. Our team of 11 RedManers integrates with Alaska's ARIES dev team, and on our team we have two designers: myself, the design lead, as well as another UX designer I was asked to mentor until they would one day take on the role of design lead. At the outset of the project I authored a user-centered design plan that documented the high expectations of and strict requirements for UX research on our project, which included integrating UX research into our two week Agile sprint cadence. On the heels of authoring this document, my UX team member and myself began seeking UX opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>
                The first research project we completed was an affinity wall analysis. We conducted user interviews, extracted insights, then arranged the insights into an affinity wall, and conveyed our findings in a report. Our second research project involved conducting a usability heuristics analysis on the application. We tested the application against Nielsen’s 10 heuristics, analyzed the results, and documented an organized, prioritized list of UX improvement opportunities to act on in future sprints.

                <!--<p>An important lesson I learned on this project is the necessity of vocalizing your thoughts when you think there’s a better way to do what’s being done, or else you’ll inevitably have to fix defficiencies that will arise downstream at a higher cost. To provide more context: I gave the designer I was mentoring on this project a lot of responsibility so they could learn by doing and have ownership of the project. They conducted many of the itnerviews, completed much of the documentation and report writing, and contributed great ideas I wouldn't have thought of. But at one point during the affinity wall analysis, our approaches to constructing the wall differed. I knew from experience my way was better but I didn't vocalize my thoughts intentionally enough; I didn't effectively influence without authority. I should have said something like "I see value in doing it this way; let's try it and if it does not prove fruitful we will try it a different way". But I failed to do so and deferred to the method of my fellow designer, reasoning that their approach would likely result in something 80+% as good what my method would result in, so giving them more ownership and doing it their way was the more valuable path. But when reviewing our final deliverable, I noticed our Affinity wall was not as sensical, not as useful as it could be--that the insights revealed by the wall were not as clearly articulated or represented as they could be, and that this was the result of the way we constructed the wall. While hustling at the last minute to change the wall and refactor the report so our deliverable would be stronger, I committed this lesson to memory: speak up when you see an opportunity to add value, or else your deliverable won't be as strong as it could be. And endeavor to strike a balance between giving mentees ownership and guiding them as to what you think is the best path.</p>
