                <p class="lead border-bottom mt-2 mb-3 pb-3">Leading a multidisciplinary team through the research and design of a progressive web application facilitating alternative justice programs in Marin County, California.</p>
                <p>Our team of 6 (1 project manager, 1 business analyst, 3 devs, and myself) had 12 weeks to build a web application that would facilitate a jail-alternative program program by allowing offenders to receive one day of jail credit for every 8 hours of work performed for a non-profit agency; a solition that reduces costs for the County of Marin, very significantly reduces the actual time served by offenders without keeping offenders from their homes, all while benefiting non-profits throughout the community.</p>
                <p>As the designer I drove our rapid protyping and front-end design efforts. Our process began with paper prototyping screens from feature requirements. We combined our sketches into an interactive Marvel prototype and conduced usability tests. We then arranged the sketches into a journey map using Miro. From this map we structured the navigation and IA, determined which components we would need for development, and mapped them to components in the bootstrap framework. Then we began iteratively wireframing and then high-fidelity prototyping UI in Adobe XD, then the devs and I coded the front end in bootstrap and they integrated it with the CMS. Finally we conducted more usability tests, refined, and deployed the web app, which is now live.<p>
